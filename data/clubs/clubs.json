      "about": "<strong>How the Commercial Hockey Club was formed</strong><br /><br />The Commercial Hockey Club (CHC) was formed in 1944, when a group of high school students at the State Commercial High School in George Street, Brisbane, formed a J2 team to play in the Brisbane Junior Hockey fixtures. The founding members included Stan Griffin OAM, Eric Vile, Arnold Dodd, K. Schwede, T Lang and R Mavromatie.<br /><br />By the end of 1945, most of the original members had left high school and in 1946 CHC fielded a B2 team and a J2 team. The number of our teams grew over the following years and in 1949 CHC won its first premiership in the B1 Grade.<br /><br />Our first women's team was formed in 1949.<br /><br />It has been a fantastic rollercoaster ride up to the present where we have become Brisbane Hockey's foremost family club.",

      "about": "The Sports Master of Bulimba State School, Mr. Harry Quinn, purchased 22 (ex-Army Disposal) hockey sticks (the old English style with the long hook), and while they were worse for wear with worn hooks from being used on gravel bull rings, those sticks played an important role in establishing a stronghold for the sport in Bulimba.<br /><br />Harry Quinn was a remarkable man. While being a teacher at the school, he had no playing experience in the game of hockey but encouraged the youngsters to respect the rules of the game. With the co-operation of Ralph Wakefield, Quinn established a primary school competition on the southside of the Brisbane River with Norman Park, Morningside, Cannon Hill and Bulimba playing fixtures on Friday (Sports Day) at Bulimba Memorial Park.",
